# JavaHomeworkDay2 - Day 2 of Week 3/12 (JAVA week)
It's the second day since we started JAVA at Sparta Academy.

We were asked to write methods that will:
1. Take in a String parameter and check if it's a palindrome ("abcdcba" -> true, "abca" -> false)
2. Take in a String parameter and return the longest palindrome ("ananbvcvbape" -> "bvcvb")


//Methods
public static boolean checkPalindrome(String string);

public static String getLongestPalindrome(String string);
